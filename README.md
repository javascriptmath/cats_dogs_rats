# Cats, Dogs, and Rats Minigame

Welcome to the **Cats, Dogs, and Rats Minigame**, a fun and dynamic simulation game built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas!

## 🎮 Game Overview

In the **Cats, Dogs, and Rats Minigame**, each animal type has a unique behavior:

- **Cats** chase rats and avoid dogs.

- **Animal Class:** Represents each animal (cat, dog, rat) with properties and methods for movement, interaction, and drawing.
- **Game Loop:** A continuous loop that updates the canvas, checks for interactions, and determines the winner.
- **Collision Detection:** Animals detect nearby threats or targets and react accordingly.
